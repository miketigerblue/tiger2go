# Config.toml - Removing this from ignore so we track the default config structure, 
# but usually users might have a Config.local.toml. 
# For this repo, Config.toml seems to be the template.
# If Config.toml contains secrets, it should be ignored.
# The current Config.toml has dummy values for API keys.
# We will keep Config.toml tracked for now as it is the example.
