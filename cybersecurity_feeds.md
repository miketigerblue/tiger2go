# TigerBlue OSINT Dashboard – **Licence-Compliant Feed List**

Every feed below is either U.S.-government public-domain, released under the UK Open Government Licence (OGL v3.0) or published under a permissive Creative Commons licence.  That means you can legally display _headline + short AI summary + link-back_ in a public dashboard with only minimal attribution.

> **Important:** If you enable any additional feeds you _must_ verify the licence terms yourself before deploying them to a public instance.

## 👣 Attribution requirements

* **CISA & other US-Gov feeds:** no legal attribution required, but a courtesy line such as `© CISA (US Government, public domain)` is good practice.
* **UK NCSC (OGL v3.0):** must include `© Crown copyright 20XX, NCSC. Contains public-sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.`
* **SANS ISC (CC BY-NC-SA):** non-commercial use only; include `© SANS Internet Storm Center – CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 US` with a link back.
* **CERT-EU (CC BY 4.0):** include `© CERT-EU – CC BY 4.0` + link.

The dashboard displays this attribution in the article card footer and again in the `/sources` page.

## 🛠 Adding a new feed

1. **Check the licence** – look for CC, OGL, US-Gov PD, or equivalent.  When in doubt, e-mail the publisher.
2. **Update `Cargo.toml`** – add `licence = "…"` and appropriate tags.
3. **Limit excerpt** – the public cache stores **≤ 100 characters** of AI-generated summary and the original headline only.
4. **Run `cargo test`** – ensure the parser and licence checker pass.
5. **Deploy** – watch logs for `LicenceWarning` on first ingest.
